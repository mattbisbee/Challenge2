# Challenge2
## Creating a Portfolio Page #
---
### This project was an effort to create a styled page to show my current skills.
---
### **General Info:**
The first basic requirements given were to have a portfolio page with the developers name and a recent photo. I chose a more humourous tone with my photo but was able to use border radius to make it into a circle. I also used a background image from a photo I took a while ago while hiking in the mountains for the header. I overlaid my name and the nav links on the background image and added some text spacing to my name. Also, as instructed, I included a section about my background, both personal and professional. A contact section was also required and I included it at the bottom of the page.

### **Working Links:**
The other requirements that were given was to have links in the navagation bar that take the reader to the different sections of the page and projects links that take you to the deployed projects. The nav links light up when the mouse hovers over them and they link to the different areas on the web page. I also included links in the deployed projects that take the reader to the project in a different tab. For the contact me section, I have links to my email address, GitHub page, and Linkedin. Each link has a small hover effect when the mouse hovers over them and each directs the reader to my profile page or, as with the gmail link, it opens the email program to send an email with my adddress filled in already.

### **Projects**
The images were to showcase my deployed projects and have room to add a few more. The placeholder backround images and the backgroundimages for the header and footer were added in CSS. In html, I added the title attribute to the article that contained the CSS styling with decriptions of the images. This is a nice CSS trick which allows me to use the title attribute to perform a similair function as the alt attribute. The entire image of the deployed projects is the button that, when clicked, will lead the reader to the deployed websites in another tab. Also, my first project image is the largest of the images, as required. Lastly, I wrote the code to be displayed on 1080p screens and included media queries for four different smaller screen sizes top make this site responsive to different screens. 

### **Final Notes**
Overall, I tried to use as many of the concepts we have been studying about, even though they were not explicity required. I used semantic elements throughout the page and included alt attributes for the images. I added my own favicon using an image I took in Amsterdam of a slice of dutch apple pie. All the other images on the page were images taken by me (excluding the project images of the deployed websites). I also wrote notes in the CSS and HTML files.
