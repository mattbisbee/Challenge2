## Creating a Portfolio Page #
---
### This project was an effort to create a styled page to show my current skills.
---
### **General Info:**
The first basic requirements given were to have a portfolio page with the developers name and a recent photo. I chose a more humourous tone with my photo but was able to use border radius to make it into a circle. I also used a background image from a photo I took a while ago while hiking in the mountains for the header. I overlaid my name and the nav links on the background image and added some text spacing to my name. Also, as instructed, I included a section about my background, both personal and professional. A contact section was also required and I included it at the bottom of the page. I have links to my email address, GitHub page, and Linkedin. Each link has a small animation when the mouse hovers over them and takes the reader to my profile pages for each link. The email link opens the email program so that the reader can send me an email if they so desire.

### **Working Links:**
The other requirements that were given was to have links in the navagation bar that take the reader to the different sections of the page and projects links that take you to the deployed projects. The nav links light up when the mouse hovers over them and they link to the different areas on the web page. I also included links in the deployed projects that take the reader to the project in a different tab. 

### **Projects**
The images were to showcase my deployed projects and have room to add a few more. I chose to use background images of the deployed sites with the title of the image clickable in order to direct the reader to the website. The titles light up when the mouse hovers over them and they direct the reader to the deplyed site in another tab. It also required that the first project have the largest iamge on the page. I decided to use the Run Buddy site as my number 1 site and this takes up more room then the other three. Lastly, as required, I wrote the page to be displayed on 1080p screens and included media queries for four different smaller screen sizes so that the page would resize when viewing on smaller screens.

### **Final Notes**
Overall, I tried to use as many of the concepts we have been studying about, even though they were not explicity required. I used semantic elements throughout the page and included alt attributes for the images. Since I used the images as background, instead of using alt="", I used title="" in the appropriate divs and added text that describes each image.
